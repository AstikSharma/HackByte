# Anonimo

Anonimo is a web-based platform designed to facilitate anonymous video calls while ensuring user privacy and security. With Anonimo, users have the option to utilize AI-generated faces that are superimposed over their own during video calls, providing digital anonymity and protection against potential misuse of their real identity.

## Features

- **Anonymous Video Calls:** Conduct video calls without revealing your true identity.
- **AI-Generated Faces:** Choose from a variety of AI-generated faces to represent yourself during calls.
- **Enhanced Security:** Protect your privacy and security against potential screenshots or misuse of personal information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless navigation and interactive experience. 

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** Utilized for strong typing and improved developer experience.
- **React:** Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Gen AI:** AI technology used for generating realistic faces for anonymity.
- **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment for server-side logic.
- **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js used for building RESTful APIs.
- **CSS:** Styling language for designing visually appealing user interfaces.
-**WebRTC(Socket.io):** WebSockets are used for real-time, event-driven communication between clients and servers. They are particularly useful for building software applications requiring instant updates, such as real-time chat, messaging, and multiplayer games.
